# Data dialogue

The data dialogue is a format that should bring together the community and potential partner organizations. Here, discussion and exchange are in the foreground, but it is also possible that independent projects develop out of the dialogue. The first step for a data dialogue is to identify potential partner organizations in the region of the local group. In this case, it may be appropriate to address different organizations from one area \(e.g. refugee aid\), but a thematic approach is not necessary. Responsible for this step is the project manager at the local level. Templates that can help you with this step can be found in the appendix. In a second step, a suitable date and room must be found. For tips on room booking, look again in the section about organizational structure, there we give some examples. After partner organizations, space and date are chosen, the community comes into play. In order to get enough potential data analysts to come along to support the organizations, a little bit of advertising has to be done. It makes sense to create a Facebook event that can be spread across CorrelAid channels and to send invitations via mailing lists from student councils or other organizations. A template for event texts and invitations can be found in the appendix. If you have the opportunity to print cheap posters, you could also use them as a form of advertising. \[Template?\] If it becomes clear during the dialogue with a specific organization that a joint project would be possible, it would be a good opportunity for the project manager or local managers to stay in touch afterwards. If you have any questions, please keep in close contact with the project manager at CorrelAid.
