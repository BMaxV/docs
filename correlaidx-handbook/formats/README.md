## Hackathons

The concept of the hackathon comes originally from the hardware and software development and designates events in which complex problems are to be solved in the best possible way in a relatively short time \(usually in the range of about half to about three days\). The participants of a hackathon ideally form interdisciplinary teams, in which they work together on the task. The competitive situation and the time pressure should promote the development of new and creative solutions. Depending on the size and type of hackathon, the solutions developed at the end of the event will be judged by a jury and, if applicable, awarded. For the context of the CorrelAid Local Chapter, hackathons are a great way to give data science-interested students first-hand insights into practical data analysis.

The first step in planning a hackathon is the question of the scope and format of the event:

* Should there be a standard task for all participants, or should several projects be available in different difficulty stages?
* How long should the hackathon last and when should it take place? Are there any university events to which the hackathon can be attached?
* How many participants \* are expected?

Once you have answered these basic questions, you can get into the specific organization: As always, a room should be booked early for the hackathon. This should ideally have a free seating and a large number of sockets. For larger events, it is advisable to book two rooms, otherwise the noise level can become too high. In hackathons, it is customary that the organizers provide a certain basic set of drinks \(coke, mate, water, beer ..\) and food \(pizza\). At multi-day events, the workrooms are usually open around the clock and full catering is available. For examples regarding catering see section \(Structure of the Local Group - Catering\).

The most important success criterion of a hackathon is the selection of a good task. Ideally, it is a "real life" problem, so the solutions found may even be put to practical use later. For example, potential issues may arise during a data dialogue or may be based on other, freely available data \(open government, etc.\). However, it is important that no sensitive / personal data is used on a hackathon. Examples of tasks of successful hackathons:

* Analysis of data of the Bundesfernstraßengesellschaft on the impact of the blockage of the Rheintalbahn on the truck traffic.
* Analysis of a data dump from FlightRadar to identify violations of the no-fly ban at German airports.
* Identification of hacker attacks in network logs.

In addition, it would be helpful if contact persons familiar with the data are constantly available during the hackathon and can help with questions and problems.

## Panel discussion

Panel discussions are a good way to start a kick-off event for a new local group. Together with experts, the relevance of the topics "Data4Good" or "Data analysis for civil society" and the associated need to found a new local group can be discussed. Panel discussions often revolve around a provocatively formulated question that can possibly stimulate a diverse debate.

The planning of a panel discussion should start 3 months before the date of the panel discussion at best. At the beginning it should be defined which main topic the podium discussion basically should have \(partly also depending on the objective of the local group \(see three columns above\)\). Then you have to decide how many perspectives on this topic can be raised and define a corresponding number of discussants. Building on this, potential discussants must be addressed and contacted. It makes sense to first refer to the contacts of CorrelAid Germany. Johannes or Arndt can give you the best feedback. In addition to these "celebrities" you should ensure that at least 1-2 discussants come from your region, so that the interested can see a familiar face. It is best to contact a method professor. However, also pay attention to maintaining a balanced gender mix for the panel discussion. When contacting the discussants, be sure to formulate the most concrete invitation email - it should be clear when the event will take place, who else will be invited, what questions you will ask, and why you have contacted exactly this person. It should also be clear at this time who should act as moderator for the panel discussion. At best, this is a member of the CorrelAidX group with a bit of experience in speaking to larger groups. The moderator should start thinking up questions early on and distinguishing between questions for all discussants and special questions for individual participants.

After the discussants have agreed, you must ensure that you book a sufficiently large room. For this purpose, it is advisable to work together with a student council of the university. They may normally reserve rooms from universities free of charge. Offer the student council that this can be a joint event so that they can also benefit from it and provide you with a little more WoMen-power. The room should have at least 50 seats; depending on the size of the university, the room may be larger.

Three weeks before your event takes place you should start promoting the event with flyers and social media postings. For flyers, ask your student council. If you organize the event together, it should not be a problem to provide 100€ for flyers. When promoting the event, make sure to choose the most appealing title and ask the discussants how they would like to be promoted. Often, discussants have more than one position. It is important to clarify the function in which they come to your event. Make sure that there is a bit of activity in the social media posting for the event - once a week, remind the participants that the event is about to start.

The room should be booked at least one week in advance to give you an overview of the premises. Furthermore, consider whether you want to organize a bit of catering. At least for the discussants it is necessary to offer water and glasses. Check several days in advance to see if you have access to the electronic infrastructure and if it works. If that is not the case, the university administration can certainly help out.

On the day of the panel discussion, make sure that the room is free and tidy at least one hour before the start of the event. Ensure that especially the external discussants are picked up and taken to the room and hang a few \(direction\) signs for interested and potential visitors. Please make sure that the discussants can be seen well from anywhere and adjust the seating accordingly. Furthermore, a photographer should be present who can take pictures from both discussants and guests well.

At the beginning of the event the moderator welcomes the guests, explains the topic of the panel discussion and introduces the discussants. Here, the discussants can already articulate input statements on the subject of the discussion. Afterwards the discussion should develop relatively fluently between moderation and discussants. At the end of the panel discussion, also the guests should be invited to participate and a conclusive statement should be made by each discussant.

If financial reasonable, the presenters may recieve small gifts. Sometimes, chocolate, flowers or CorrelAid-specific souvenirs should be fine.

Following the podium discussion, attention must again be given to social media. The best photos and a short text about the success of the panel discussion should be published. Furthermore, you can send the information to the press office of the university, so that the range is further increased.

## Introducing CorrelAid

Every now and then there is the possibility to present CorrelAid as an organization at the university or also at conferences / meetings / MeetUps. The format is completely free at this point as long as you and the organizers feel that CorrelAid can make a contribution and / or is interesting for the participants. Of course, in addition to presenting at external events, you may also like to take the initiative: Fore example, you can send a mail to your university mailing list to make them aware of your group. This may also combined with a \(founding\) event.

Various events in which CorrelAid could contribute or present themselves would be, for example, student councils or university mailing lists, student initiative fairs, similar organization events \(Code for Germany, Open Knowledge Foundation\) or panel discussions and conferences in the field of data analysis / civil society engagement.

In order to make your presentation a little easier, we have put together presentations and information materials that you are welcome to use. We can already prepare for you:

* Sticker & flyer \(still in the old design, currently redesign in progress\)
* Poster \(general and project schedule\)
* Presentation texts in different lengths or verbosities
* Powerpoint presentations for different addressees
* Reusable stock photos
* Standard cover letter separated by addressee for hosting various events

The material can be found in the CorrelCloud, for which you must first be activated as a user. When preparing an event or contribution, please contact the Community Manager at CorrelAid. Here we can jointly consider which formats and documents fit best for you. If you need help with a bigger event, you can also contact us here.

## workshops

The aim of workshops is to increase the professional and content-related competence of CorrelAidX members. This includes both the basic introduction to R and Python, as well as the learning of specific knowledge and packages within both programming languages. Depending on the demand, workshops should always be thought through at the beginning of the semester. This decision should include the level of input of the members and the skills of the teachers.

If there is a basic idea of the upcoming workshops, the planning for the first workshop should be started. Based on this example all following workshops can be planned. Basically one should assume that after 90 minutes learners are hardly able to process new information. Therefore, the planning should be created for about 90 minutes. A workshop session includes a brief conceptual introduction to the current session, collaborative editing of an R or Python script, and self-paced learning by learners.

The R or Python scripts do not have to be developed completely on your own. CorrelAid Germany offers teachers a basic set of R and Python scripts which can be used as a basis to plan your own workshop. If there is no template available already, it is up to the teacher to provide the script to CorrelAid Germany.

Workshops are most easily held in seminar rooms at the university. In this case, student councils can be asked for their support, as they are generally allowed to book seminar rooms. For the individual workshops invitations should be sent via social media posts at least two weeks in advance. Here the basic topic of the workshop should be explained already. In addition to the invitation, at least two reminders should be sent around so that the number of potential participants and people reached is as high as possible.

At the beginning of the workshop, the teacher explains the concrete content of the workshop and structures the lessons in accordance with their own teaching concept. Both the teacher and the students should feel comfortable in the workshop and not feel overwhelmed. At the end of the workshop, the teacher should announce to the topic of the next upcoming workshop, if applicable.

Should a relatively large number of workshops be offered, it is possible for CorrelAidX units to issue a certificate to learners about learning the basics in R or Python. In this case a attendance list must be maintained. In the best case, tasks are provided to the learners which must be solved on their own.

## Data dialogue

The data dialogue is a format that should bring together the community and potential partner organizations. Here, discussion and exchange are in the foreground, but it is also possible that independent projects develop out of the dialogue. The first step for a data dialogue is to identify potential partner organizations in the region of the local group. In this case, it may be appropriate to address different organizations from one area \(e.g. refugee aid\), but a thematic approach is not necessary. Responsible for this step is the project manager at the local level. Templates that can help you with this step can be found in the appendix. In a second step, a suitable date and room must be found. For tips on room booking, look again in the section about organizational structure, there we give some examples. After partner organizations, space and date are chosen, the community comes into play. In order to get enough potential data analysts to come along to support the organizations, a little bit of advertising has to be done. It makes sense to create a Facebook event that can be spread across CorrelAid channels and to send invitations via mailing lists from student councils or other organizations. A template for event texts and invitations can be found in the appendix. If you have the opportunity to print cheap posters, you could also use them as a form of advertising. \[Template?\] If it becomes clear during the dialogue with a specific organization that a joint project would be possible, it would be a good opportunity for the project manager or local managers to stay in touch afterwards. If you have any questions, please keep in close contact with the project manager at CorrelAid.
