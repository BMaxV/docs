# Weekly conference call

The weekly conference call \(also called "**TelKo**" from German "**Tel**efon**ko**nferenz"\) is probably the most important CorrelAid communication channel. In this call, we discuss current projects and new ideas, plan upcoming events, etc. **Anyone** can participate in the conference call, regardless of CorrelAid "experience". It is the best place to get onboarded to CorrelAid because you quickly get a full update of our current activities. 

**When**: \(almost\) every Monday, 8pm \(Central European Time\)

**Where**: via a Slack call in the \#telko channel. You need to download the app or the desktop version in order to participate in the call - the browser version is not sufficient from our experience. If you do not have a Slack account yet, you can easily get one - see [here](../faq.md#everything-seems-to-be-on-slack-how-do-i-get-on-there).

### TelKo protocol 

Outcomes of the TelKo are documented in a hackmd. Please see the \#telko channel for the links to the previous protocols.
