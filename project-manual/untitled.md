# Project stages

A typical CorrelAid project goes through XX stages.

### First contact

We have had first contact with the organization:

* they've contacted us over email
* we have met them at an event
* we have approached them and are waiting for an answer

### Ideation

We have established communication with the organization and are figuring out:

* what data do they have \(if any\)
* how can CorrelAid help them 
* what's the scope of the project 

At the end of this phase, we should have a project proposal \(LINK\) ready to be sent over our email list. 

### Finding a team / onboarding

### Project work 

### Adjourning 

### Follow-up 

### Finished / Lost
