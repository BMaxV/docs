# Welcome

Hi! Welcome to the CorrelAid docs. 

We hope you find here what you are looking for. There are three main sections:



### Wiki

How does CorrelAid work? Who do I need to talk to if I need xyz?

{% page-ref page="wiki/faq.md" %}



### CorrelAidX Manual

All about how local chapters work, what you can do in a local chapter, different possible formats etc.

{% page-ref page="correlaidx-manual/what-is-correlaidx.md" %}



### Project Manual 

A manual for project leaders of CorrelAid projects. But might be interesting to everyone else as well! 

{% page-ref page="project-manual/welcome.md" %}



If you cannot find the answer to your problem, do not hesitate to contact [frie.p@correlaid.org](mailto:frie.p@correlaid.org) or ask your question in \#netzwerk-help on Slack.
