# Welcome

Hi! Welcome to the CorrelAid docs. 

We hope you find here what you are looking for. There are three main sections:

* Wiki: how does CorrelAid work? Who do I need to talk to if I need xyz?
* CorrelAidX: all about how local chapters work, what you can do in a local chapter, different possible formats etc.
* Project Handbook: A handbook for project leaders of CorrelAid projects. But might be interesting to everyone else as well! 

If you cannot find the answer to your problem, do not hesitate to contact [frie.p@correlaid.org](mailto:frie.p@correlaid.org) or ask your question in \#netzwerk-help on Slack.
