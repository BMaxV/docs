# Ethics guide

It is also possible to carry out projects at the local level via CorrelAid. However, it is important to us that the organizations you work with on a local level in the name of CorrelAid meet our ethical requirements. CorrelAid is an independent, non-partisan and inclusive network. Through our projects we want to enable digital participation for civil society organizations and thus help them to strengthen their social impact. We fight against racism, sexism and discrimination and pay attention to equal rights within our teams and transparency in our work. We expect potential partners to share these values. When choosing cooperation partners, you should therefore attach importance to a social orientation of the partner organizations and a social added value of the projects. If you have received an interesting inquiry, please contact the project administration in the Core Team. The request will be discussed by us in the subsequent conference call and we will give you detailed feedback. For example, when working with parties, suggestions for customizing the project focus may be made to meet our standards.
