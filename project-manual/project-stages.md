# Project stages

A typical CorrelAid project goes through 6 stages.

### First contact

We have had first contact with the organization:

* they've contacted us over email
* we have met them at an event
* we have approached them and are waiting for an answer
* someone else put us into contact with them

### Ideation

The project coordinator has established communication with the organization and is figuring out:

* what data do they have \(if any\)
* how can CorrelAid help them 
* is it realistic that CorrelAid can help them?
* what's the scope of the project 

Based on this information, the project coordinator develops the project proposal in close coordination with the contact person\(s\) of the NPO.

At the end of this phase, the project coordinator sends the project proposal over our Mailchimp email list.

### Finding a team / onboarding

The project coordinator collects the applications. Once the application deadline has passed, the project coordinator looks for 1-3 suitable people to join the selection committee and they arrange for a call to decide who should join the project team. 

The project coordinator sends out the confirmation and declination emails to the applicants and establishes a first communication channel for the team, e.g. by inviting them to Slack and creating a private channel.

If possible: After finding a date with the project team, the project coordinator and the project team lead contact the NPO to organize the kick-off workshop where project team and NPO have the opportunity to meet and exchange about the project.
