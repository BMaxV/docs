# Get started!

## Finding partners

As Core Team, we want to minimize the hurdles to initiate local groups on your own. While we propose the roles "Project Coordination" and "Community Management" \(see [Role Definition](role-definitions.md)\), this is not a prerequisite for calling yourself a CorrelAidX chapter. Neither is being registered in a particular legal form, e.g. as a registered association \(although this might become relevant once you grow\). Instead, we believe it is best that you find a way of getting your CorrelAidX chapter started that fits best to your environment. Especially in the beginning it might be difficult to get rooms and get into planning of your events. Setting your chapter up in a clever way might help with that. For example:

* If you are in a university context, you could register your chapter as a university group / club or associate it with a department student council or another existing university group / club. University clubs / groups can most often book university rooms for free, they can be part of student fairs etc. Student councils can help you with reaching your target audience via email lists, room booking and general communication. Local chaupters that went this route are 
* If you are not in a university context, try to find organizations to collaborate with. Maybe you can give a talk at a local R / Python user group meetup about data-for-good. Maybe there are open data or civic tech groups in your area. Another perk of connecting with them: Existing meetup groups most likely will know where to find rooms / locations for your own meetups. 
* Ask your employer! If you work in IT, most companies will generally sponsor meetups and provide space for them. Before you associate CorrelAid with your employer, please check back with the Core Team \(see [Contact](contact.md)\). 
* If neither of the previous approaches is available to you, we will figure it out together! ðŸ’ª Don't get discouraged.

## Room booking

#### University context

As already mentioned, it is worthwhile to register your CorrelAidX chapter as an university group in order to be able to book rooms yourself at the university. Alternatively, a cooperation with a student council or with academic staff / professors at the university is an opportunity. Each of these groups should be able to book rooms via the university room booking system. Since large seminar rooms / lecture halls can be booked out over months, make sure to inquire about a room at an early stage. A realistic period is about 3 months in advance. Even if the event does not have to be completely planned at the time, you are safe regarding the location and can give other participants / helpers an exact date and place.

#### Outside university

Of course, if you are not working or studying at a university, cooperation with other associations in the area of Data4Good or IT, the booking of a coworking space or the request for foundations are also good options \(see above\). If you do not have any existing contacts yourself and do not want to contact groups, you can also ask in the \#general channel of our [Slack](https://docs.correlaid.org/wiki/faq#everything-seems-to-be-on-slack-how-do-i-get-on-there) for connections of other CorrelAid members. You are also welcome to [contact](contact.md) the community manager of the core team, Regina will be happy to assist you in your search.

Also, after a successful event, remember to select people to be responsible for cleaning up the room unless you have agreed otherwise with the organization that will provide you with the space. A good event ends only when the last visitors have left.

## Catering

#### University context

Likewise, already existing university structures can be helpful organizing the catering. One of the most effective ways to promote an event at an university is continually mentioning free food. These can be pizza as well as pretzels, slices or biscuits. The size and type of food you offer depends on the size and nature of your events as well as your personal preferences.

Further examples from our practice

* Foodsharing University / Local Group
* Order pizza
* Lubricate rolls / bake cake

#### Outside of university

If you are collaborating with a company or another meetup group, chances are good that they'll be able to provide a sponser for the food / drinks. Another option is to go to sponsors in the area. If, for example, a beverage manufacturer / trader is in the area, it is worthwhile to inquire there. If this is not the case, we can support you as well. See next section.

#### CorrelAid financial support

CorrelAid likes to support you in financing your meals. We want to make organizing an event as easy as possible for you and to prevent anyone to have further expenses in addition to his or her personal involvement in the event. However, it should be noted that we are a small club with limited resources. Therefore, please plan ahead of schedule with our financial officer \(see [Contact](contact.md)\) to ensure that the expenses can be carried safely by us.
