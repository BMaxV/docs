# CodiMD for Collaborative Writing

CodiMD is an online markdown editor that allows for live collaborative editing - like Google docs but with Markdown. CodiMD is the open source version of [HackMD](https://hackmd.io). We were long-time users of HackMD but switched to a self-hosted CodiMD for various reasons in early 2020. You can read more about the reasons [below](codimd-for-collaborative-writing.md#reasons-for-switching-to-codimd).

## Getting started 

## Authentication

We use our own Azure Active Directory for authentication. This means that you can't use your personal Microsoft account for our CodiMD. Instead, you get an acount from us.

### Requesting an account

Join the \#codimd-users channel on [Slack](../communication/slack.md#i-want-to-get-access-to-slack-how-do-i-get-it) and write a short post that you'd like an account. Within the next few ours, someone from the core team should contact you via DM with your account details. You get:

* a username of the form `firstname.firstletteroflastname@correlaid.onmicrosoft.com`. This is only a username, there's no mailbox associated with this "email" address.
* an initial password. 

### Logging in for the first time

Upon first logging in, you'll be prompted to change your initial passowrd. Please do so! You can also later change it \(see below\). You'll also be prompted to set up 2-Factor-Authentication. We recommend to use the Microsoft Authenticator App \(available for Android and iOS\). If this is not an option for you, please contact Frie \(@frie\) to figure something out.

## Reasons for switching to CodiMD

* better knowledge management: on HackMD, all of our pads were scattered across our private accounts and there was no central point to see all of them. In contrast, we were able to modify the open source version according to our needs and now have a central page where logged-in users can browse all pads. In addition, all pads are now part of the same database, so we can easily do exports and dumps of all our content if needed.
* better access control: with the self-hosted version, we have complete control who we allow on our instance. In contrast, everyone could register for HackMD and read our pads when in possession of the link. For 97% of pads, this is not a problem - we love transparency. But for the remaining 3%, this could be a problem.



We use CodiMD for pretty much everything that **we** create in our daily work. CodiMD
