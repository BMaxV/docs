# Design Guide

- Contact: Lena (marie-helen-cymorek@correlaid.org)

## General

The purpose of this short design guideline is to explain the use of our CorrelAid-specific corporate design and to reinforce the consistent use of visual elements in all communication. This includes publications, presentations and all other marketing materials both online and offline. Our Corporate Identity was developed by _Das Gute Ruft - Agentur für öko-soziale Unternehmen und Vereine_ - the information listed here is based on the Design Guide from June 2018. The Guide as well as all logos/ existing designs are available in the CorrelCloud in the PR and Public Relations folder.

 (https://correlcloud.org/index.php/apps/files/?dir=/CorrelCloud/03_pr/01_pr_oeff_arbeit&fileid=13934) or on the CorrelAid Canva account.

## Logos

The CorrelAid main logo is the central element of the brand's visual identity. It is a word-image brand - this makes the logo flexible and usable for a wide range of applications.

### Main Logo

There are three variations of this main logo which can be used on dark and light ground, with slogan or without. The files are stored as .png and .svg on the CorrelCloud.

### Local Chapter Logos

The CorrelAidX logos are an adaptation of the main logos. In addition to the "C", the logo also shows the suffix "X" which expresses that CorrelAid is available in various cities. Instead of the claim the city name is inserted in line 2. If you want to customize a logo specifically for your city, please contact Lena Junka (junka.lena@gmail.com). The logos are stored as .png and .svg on the CorrelCloud.

Here's an example:

### Additional Logos

For some events we need more specific logos that can be easily and quickly designed with Canva. One example is the Fellowship Program of April 2019.

If you need a special CorrelAid logo version, just write an email to Lena C. To avoid brand confusion, please do not create your own logo versions. 


## Color Concepts

Looking at the previous two logos, it becomes clear that there are two different colour concepts for the CorrelAid and CorrelAidX main brands. These are briefly explained here. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/4rJF3fO.png)_Color Segments CorrelAid_

The CorrelAid logo picks up the colour spectrum from green to blue. The color red is primarily used in the logo design of CorrelAid X (cities / regional organizations). In addition, dark grey is used as a contrast color. Please adhere to the given color values in future designs and representations in order to keep our products combinable.

_Color Segements CorrelAidX_

The CorrelAidX logo picks up the colour spectrum from red to blue. Besides the X, the color red is a main differentiator between CorrelAid and CorrelAid X and should therefore be used uniformly. Dark grey is again used as contrast colour.

## Font

The font family "Roboto" was chosen for the corporate design of CorrelAid. In detail we use Roboto Regular, Light and Bold - please do not use any other fonts for the sake of uniformity.  

## Canva

CorrelAid has a Canva (http://canva.com) Pro-Account, on which certain basic rules, such as club colors, logos, fonts, etc. are already maintained. If you want to design a product (flyer, poster, FB banner...) for your local group / information event, either contact Lena C. or get your own account. 

### Photos

On Canva, the "Logos", "Team" and "Work" folders already contain some "representative" images of past Meet-Ups and events. You are welcome to use them. In the sense of uniformity (almost) all pictures will be covered with a gradient.

Canva also provides its own pictures but they sometimes look very posed or are not free of charge. Therefore, we would like to ask you to use them as seldom as possible. 

### Products

Canva already has a wide range of CorrelAid products to choose from. With many designs you only have to exchange a picture or update the flyer text. 
Here are the most important and most frequently used products:
