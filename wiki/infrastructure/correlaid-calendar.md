# CorrelAid Calendar

We have a CorrelAid calendar to keep recurring meetings, special events such as the meetup and events where we will be present. 

The calendar is hosted on the [CorrelCloud](correlcloud.md), our Nextcloud instance, in the account of Frie. The calendar is public to everyone to read \(_read access_\) . People with a [CorrelCloud](correlcloud.md) account can also edit and add events \(_read + write access\)_. 

### Links

* _read access_: [https://correlcloud.org/index.php/apps/calendar/p/w4ak9WY4T6Ln452r/CorrelAid](https://correlcloud.org/index.php/apps/calendar/p/w4ak9WY4T6Ln452r/CorrelAid)
* _read + write access_ 
  * login to your CorrelCloud account
  * go to the calendar tab on the top left 
  * click on the three-dot symbol next to the "CorrelAid" calendar. Click on "Link". This is your personal link for read +  write access. It should have the form:`https://correlcloud.org/remote.php/dav/calendars/ + username + /correlaid/` 

### Clients

Nextcloud keeps its calendars in the [CalDAV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CalDAV) format which has implications how the calendar can be accessed in various clients. The ones tried so far are listed here with instructions or links to instructions. Please let Frie know if something does not work as described here or you have figured out a new OS / client. 

### Linux
