# FAQ

## Everything seems to be on Slack! How do I get on there?

If you want to become part of our Slack, drop an email to [Frie](mailto:frie.p@correlaid.org) or [Regina](mailto:regina.s@correlaid.org). If you are already member of our Slack and would like to see your friend become part of the team, you can also [request an invite](https://slack.com/intl/en-de/help/articles/201330256-Invite-new-members-to-your-workspace#request-an-invitation) from within Slack. 

## Do you also have email? 

Yes, sure! You can find some of our contacts [on the website](https://correlaid.org/contact). Or in the answer to the question above. ðŸ˜‰ 

## I want to create a GitHub / GitLab repository for my project and add my team to it. How do I do it?

Please send a Slack message to Frie \(@frie\) with:

* the name you want the repository to have
* the GitHub / GitLab user names of the project team members
* whether the project should be public or private

## I can't push to the Git repository \("access rights" error\). What's up there?

You don't seem to have the correct permissions. Ping Frie and she'll grant you the correct permissions.
