# Organizational structure

## Organizational structure of your chapters

As Core Team, we want to minimize the hurdles to initiate local groups on your own. This means for you that we do not prescribe any particular form \(for example, a registered association, etc.\). In addition to the established roles "Project Coordination" and "Community Management" \(see section Role Definition\), everything is organically organized. Despite this open approach, it can be helpful, for example, to register the local group as a group at an university or to associate it with a student council. Such an organizational form can be very helpful regarding the room booking and planning of events. Since the requirements for the establishment of a university group vary greatly from university to university, we must refer you to the relevant contact person \(student advisory service, student council\) of your university for information about the further procedures. However, what we can do at this point is to provide you with some "best practice" examples from our work, as you will encounter the same issues of room booking and meals.

## Room booking

As already mentioned, it is worthwhile to use the constitution as an university group in order to be able to book rooms yourself at the university. Alternatively, the cooperation with a student council or with academic staff / professors at the university is an opportunity. Each of these groups should be able to book rooms via the university room booking system. Since large seminar rooms / lecture halls can be booked out over months, make sure to inquire about a room at an early stage. A realistic period is about 3 months in advance. Even if the event does not have to be completely planned at the time, you are therefore safe regarding the premises and can give other participants / helpers an exact date and place.

Of course, if you are not working or studying at a university, cooperation with other associations in the area of Data4Good, the booking of a coworking space or the request for foundations are also a good option. If you are planning to organize an event outside of the university, take a look at the OK Labs of the OKNF \(website\), the Dataspace from SAP in Berlin, the Telefonica Foundation or or ... If you are looking for rooms outside the university, you are welcome to contact the community manager or the core team, he or she is happy to assist you in your search.

Also, after a successful event, remember to select people to be responsible for cleaning up the room unless you have agreed otherwise with the organization that will provide you with the space. A good event ends only when the last visitors have left.

## catering

Likewise, already existing university structures can be helpful organizing the catering. One of the most effective ways to promote an event is continually mentioning free food. These can be pizza as well as pretzels, slices or biscuits. The size and type of food you offer depends on the size and nature of your events as well as your personal preferences.

CorrelAid likes to support you in financing your meals. We want to make organizing an event as easy as possible for you and to prevent anyone to have further expenses in addition to his or her personal involvement in the event. However, it should be noted that we are a small club with limited resources. Therefore, please plan ahead of schedule with our financier to ensure that they can be carried safely by us. Another option is of course to go to sponsors in the area. If, for example, a beverage manufacturer / trader is in the area, it is worthwhile to inquire there.
