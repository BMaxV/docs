# Keybase

CorrelAid has a Keybase _big team_ with the name **wearecorrelaid:** [https://keybase.io/team/wearecorrelaid](https://keybase.io/team/wearecorrelaid). A Keybase _big team_ is more or less like a Slack workspace, e.g. channels can be created etc. 

Within the CorrelAid teams, there is the subteam **wearecorrelaid.chamberofsecrets**. Members of this teams have access to the encrypted git `correlaid_secrets` which contains the kdbx files needed to access passwords of CorrelAid accounts. See Password Management.
