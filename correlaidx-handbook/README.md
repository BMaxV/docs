# CorrelAidX Handbook

## What is CorrelAidX?

CorrelAid is a network of young data analysts who use their knowledge acquired from study and career to help non-profit organizations to better understand and analyze their data. CorrelAid is based on three pillars: In Germany, we play a pioneering role in data analysis consulting for organizations with a social mandate. We connect young and dedicated data scientists and provide them with a platform to apply and expand their knowledge. We also initiate dialogues on the value and benefits of data and data analysis for civil society. Our three pillars - consultancy, networking, dialogue - should also be implemented on a local level, with the focus being on local opportunities. First of all ambitious and data-affine people should find each other. Whether you bring mainly local people together and train them \( _networking_ \), conduct local projects \( _consultancy_ \) or discuss the relationship of data and society \( _dialogue_ \) - you are free in your choice. This handbook will give you an overview of different formats at the local level. Within this handbook the collected knowledge from already implemented formats flows together in order to aid you in an uncomplicated implementation. The appendix contains templates that you can use to create your own events. If you have any questions or suggestions, please pass them on to regina.s@correlaid.org, as this guide is designed to grow together with CorrelAid and your experiences.

## Task and function of CorrelAidX

CorrelAidX performs three major tasks at the local level:

1. Communicate the vision and ideas of CorrelAid
2. Offer workshops and training opportunities
3. Contact with and advice of civil society groups in the regions.

Based on these three pillars, CorrelAidX institutionalizes itself as an anchor point for data-interested people as well as contact persons for regional civil society actors.

The communication of the vision and ideas of CorrelAid first takes place through the kick-off events when a new CorrelAidX local chapter is established. Here, our network is presented to a broad public and discussed openly about our vision. Further events and panel discussions spread the vision of a data-affine society.

In order to find your way in an ever more data-based world, everyone has to be given the necessary tools. For this purpose, we offer workshops for young students and interested people to learn R and Python and show the possibilities offered by the analysis of data for studies, work and everyday life.

Contact with civil society groups in the region provides a reference point to another pillar of CorrelAid's vision. We want to help civil society achieve its mission and goals even better in a data-driven world. Direct contact with regional social groups also allows CorrelAid to support smaller initiatives and ensure that no-one is left behind.
